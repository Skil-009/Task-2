Here are concise answers to the interview questions.
1. What is phishing?
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where malicious actors impersonate a trusted entity to deceive victims into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or installing malware. These attacks are most commonly carried out via email.
2. How to identify a phishing email?
You can identify a phishing email by looking for key indicators:
A sender's email address that is slightly different from the official domain.
Links that, when hovered over, point to a different, non-official URL.
A sense of urgency or threats.
Spelling and grammatical mistakes.
Generic greetings instead of your personal name.
Unexpected attachments or requests for sensitive information.
3. What is email spoofing?
Email spoofing is the act of forging an email's sender address (From: field) to make it appear as though the email came from a legitimate source, such as a known individual or a trusted organization. It's a core technique used in phishing attacks.
4. Why are phishing emails dangerous?
Phishing emails are dangerous because they can lead to:
Identity Theft: Attackers steal personal information to impersonate the victim.
Financial Loss: They can capture banking credentials or credit card details.
Malware Infection: Links or attachments can install malware, such as ransomware or spyware.
Credential Compromise: Stolen credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to personal, financial, and corporate accounts.
5. Can you verify the sender's authenticity?
Yes, you can verify a sender's authenticity by analyzing the email headers. Specifically, by checking the results of authentication protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. A "pass" result for these checks indicates that the email genuinely originated from a server authorized by that domain.
6. What tools can analyze email headers?
Several online tools can help analyze email headers:
MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer
Google Admin Toolbox: Messageheader
G Suite Messageheader
WhatIsMyIPAddress Email Header Analyzer
7. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?
Do Not Click: Do not click on any links or download any attachments.
Do Not Reply: Replying confirms your email address is active.
Report: Use the "Report Phishing" or "Report Junk" feature in your email client (e.g., Gmail, Outlook). In a corporate setting, report it to the IT or security department immediately.
Delete: After reporting, delete the email.
8. How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?
Attackers use social engineering to manipulate human psychology. They exploit emotions like:
Fear and Urgency: Creating panic (e.g., "Your account will be suspended").
Curiosity: Using intriguing subject lines (e.g., "You have a new message").
Greed: Offering fake prizes or discounts.
Trust: Impersonating authority figures or trusted brands to lower suspicion.
